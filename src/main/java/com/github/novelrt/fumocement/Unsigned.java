 * Indicates that the annotated signed type is a unsigned type coming from the native land.

 * On Kotlin, you can use the {@code ULong}, {@code UInt}, {@code UShort} and {@code UByte} types
 * to restore the unsigned semantics.

 * On Java, you're screwed! Nice meme - FumoCement<br>
 * ...That is, unless you use the unsigned number methods in Java 8, such as {@link Long#divideUnsigned(long, long)}.
