/**
 * Represents an object managed natively using a handle, which is a native pointer
 * represented by a {@code long}.
 * <p>
 * Native objects can be either <i>owned</i>, <i>unowned</i>, or <i>cleaned</i>.<br>
 * Owned objects have native resources under the possession of the JVM, meaning that their {@link HandleDeleter}
 * will be ran once the object gets garbage collected, thus releasing any native resources.
 * This routine is ran by a {@link Cleaner}.<br>
 * On the other hand, unowned objects do not have any mechanism running once they
 * get garbage collected. They mainly serve as an access layer to resources managed natively.<br>
 * Finally, a cleaned object has been definitively deleted from the native space, and must not
 * be used anymore.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example:</b>
 * <pre>{@code public class Example extends NativeObject {
 *   public Example() {
 *     super(createStruct(), true, Example::destroyStruct);
 *   }
 *
 *   protected Example(long handle, boolean isOwned) {
 *     super(handle, isOwned, Example::destroyStruct);
 *   }
 *
 *   private static native long createStruct();
 *
 *   private static native void destroyStruct(long handle);
 *
 *   public native void someMethod(int param);
 * }
 * }</pre>
